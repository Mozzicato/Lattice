# Physics: Newton's Second Law

Newton's Second Law states that the force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration.

The fundamental equation is:

$$F = ma$$

where:
- F is the force in Newtons
- m is the mass in kilograms
- a is the acceleration in meters per second squared

## Kinetic Energy

The kinetic energy of an object in motion is given by:

$$E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$

where v is the velocity in meters per second.

## Work-Energy Theorem

The work done on an object equals the change in kinetic energy:

$$W = \Delta E_k = E_{k,f} - E_{k,i}$$
