Here’s a **clean, realistic user journey** that matches the **current design doc exactly** — learning-first, voice-enabled, no simulations, no cross-paper stuff.

I’ll describe **what the user does**, **what they feel**, and **what the system does**.

# 🧠 Lattice — User Journey (Voice-Enabled Learning)

## Persona

**User:** University student
**Situation:** Studying late, confused, notes are messy, paper feels impossible

---

## 1. Opening Lattice — *Zero pressure*

The user opens Lattice.

They see one calm prompt:

> **“Upload a paper, homework, or your notes.”**

No feature list.
No AI buzzwords.

They upload:

* a PDF of a difficult paper
* photos of handwritten notes

**System behavior:**

* Shows clear progress steps:

  * Reading pages
  * Extracting formulas
  * Understanding structure
  * Preparing tutor mode

The user feels: *“Okay, it’s doing something real.”*

---

## 2. Page View — *Nothing disappears*

The document opens **page by page**.

* Original pages are visible.
* Important equations are softly highlighted.
* Nothing feels skipped or rewritten yet.

The user clicks an equation.

A side panel opens:

> **“Let’s understand this.”**

---

## 3. Tutor Mode Begins — *Guided, not dumped*

The system explains the equation in **plain language**.

* No derivation yet.
* No symbols overload.

Then it asks:

> **“Before we go deeper — what do you think this equation is trying to describe?”**

The user hesitates… then **presses the mic button** and speaks.

---

## 4. Think-Aloud Learning — *This is different*

The user says:

> “I think this part shows how the system loses energy over time, but I’m not sure.”

**System behavior:**

* Transcribes the response.
* Detects partial understanding.
* Responds gently, in voice:

> “You’re right about energy loss. Let’s refine that idea.”

No “wrong answer.”
No correction tone.

The user feels safe to continue.

---

## 5. Mental Model Builder — *Clarity appears*

The system reframes the equation:

* “This term **pushes** the system”
* “This term **resists motion**”
* “This term **stores past behavior**”

Spoken slowly, calmly.

Then it asks:

> “Which part do you think would matter most if the system slowed down?”

The user answers verbally again.

Understanding starts to **click**.

---

## 6. “I’m Lost” Moment — *Handled perfectly*

The user suddenly feels overwhelmed.

They press:

> **“I’m lost — explain this differently.”**

**System behavior:**

* Voice slows slightly.
* Language becomes more intuitive.
* Math symbols are temporarily removed.

> “Let’s ignore the equation for a moment and talk about the idea.”

The user relaxes.

This is the moment where most tools fail — **Lattice doesn’t**.

---

## 7. Beautification — *From chaos to confidence*

Later, the user clicks:

> **“Beautify my notes.”**

Each page is processed **one by one**.

For every page:

* Original (left)
* Clean version (right)

The clean version:

* Fixes grammar
* Rewrites explanations clearly
* Renders formulas perfectly
* Preserves the user’s meaning

Low-confidence areas are highlighted gently:

> “Please review this formula.”

The user feels relief:
*“This finally looks like something I can study from.”*

---

## 8. Wrap-Up — *Confidence, not exhaustion*

At the end, Lattice says (text + optional voice):

> “You’ve worked through the core ideas on these pages.
> You should now be able to explain this concept in your own words.”

The user downloads:

* Clean notes
* A short summary of what they learned

They don’t feel “done” — they feel **capable**.

---

## 🧩 Why This Journey Works

* No pressure to be smart
* Voice allows thinking out loud
* Mistakes are treated as progress
* Understanding is built, not assumed

This is not an AI tool.

It’s a **thinking companion**.
